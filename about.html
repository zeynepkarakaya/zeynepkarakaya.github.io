						<p class="para">Hello again! I am Zeynep, a UX Designer (to be) with a diverse background and experience in strategy and management. I heard  experience design term for the first time when I was working on a project for one of the biggest banks in Australia in 2018. Right after completing my Master's in International Management degree in 2019, i started learning the skills and techniques in user experience design and I fell in love with the field! Then, in the middle of a pandemic, I found myself in The Hague, pursuing another degree as i found my passion.</p>
						<p class="para">I have been always a person who loves thinking  practical solutions for everyday problems, even when people think there is no problem. Thanks to my background, I have experienced working in international and/or virtual environment, and I quite enjoy it! I have a special interest in startups especially in fintech and transportation sectors, but this does not mean I won't be interested in your product. I generally love learning new things from each project, so if I have never worked in your sector, I will be interested in working with you even more! Last but not least, I love traveling and tasting different cuisines. Where was the last place you visited before pandemic started?</p>
