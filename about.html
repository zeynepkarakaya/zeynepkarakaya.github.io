					<p>Hello again! I am Zeynep, a UX Designer with a diverse background and experience in strategy and management. I heard  experience design term for the first time when I was working on a project for one of the biggest financial institutions in Australia in 2018. Right after completing my Master's in International Management degree in 2019, I started to learn the skills, tools, and methods used in user experience design and I fell in love with the field! Then, in the middle of a pandemic, I found myself applying higher degree programs as I want to learn more on the field. As a result, currently I am here in Salzburg and pursuing Human-Computer Interaction Master's Program at PLUS and FH Salzburg.</p>
					<p>I have been always a person who loves thinking  practical solutions for everyday problems, even when people think there is no problem as system in use id working okay. Thanks to my background, I have experienced working in international and/or virtual environments, and I quite enjoyed it! I have a special interest in startups especially in fintech and transportation sectors, but this does not mean I won't be interested in other sectors. In general, I love learning something new from each project I work for, so if I have never worked in a sector, I will be interested even more! </p>
					<p>Last but not least, I love traveling and tasting different cuisines. I am a coffee and summer person, for sure! (Yes, I agree this is a bit contrast the fact that I am currently living in the middle of mountains and ski resorts, but I love skiing, as well!)</p>
