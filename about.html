						<h3 class="heading-medium">About Me</h3> 
						<p>Hello again! I am Zeynep, a UX Designer (to be) with a diverse background and experience in strategy and management. I heard  experience design term for the first time when I was working on a project for one of the biggest banks in Australia in 2018. Right after completing my Master's in International Management degree in 2019, I started learning the skills and techniques in user experience design and I fell in love with the field! Then, in the middle of a pandemic, I found myself in The Hague, pursuing another degree as I found my passion.</p>
						<p>I have been always a person who loves thinking  practical solutions for everyday problems, even when people think there is no problem. Thanks to my background, I have experienced working in international and/or virtual environment, and I quite enjoy it! I have a special interest in startups especially in fintech and transportation sectors, but this does not mean I won't be interested in your product. I generally love learning something new from each project, so if I have never worked in your sector, I will be interested in working with you even more! Last but not least, I love traveling and tasting different cuisines. I am a coffee and summer person, for sure!</p>

						<h2 class="heading-small">Work Experience</h2> 
						<p class="para"> I have been working since 2015 and worked in various sectors, different sizes of companies, and so on. Below is a snapshot of my recent and most relevant work experience.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>UpWork, Freelance UX Designer</li>
							<p>I have been working as a freelance designer on UpWork. I like meeting people from all around the world and expanding my knowledge in different sectors through the projects I take. You can check my Upwork profile from <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~016d9dff557bf441e6">here</a>. Recently I completed an application UI Design project for a client based in The Netherlands.</p> 
							<a href="project2.html">See project details</a>
							<li>Turkish Industry and Business Association, Entrepreneurship and Youth Affairs</li>
							<p>Turkish Industry and Business Association is the most well-known and biggest association in Turkey. As the CEOs or senior professionals of local and international companies operating in Turkey are members of this association, I had the chance to work with some of them over there. I was working with the Entrepreneurship and Youth Affairs team and we were executing one annual entrepreneurship competition, intra-company entrepreneurship best practice seminars and workshops, as well as writing suggestion notes for a better entrepreneurship ecosystem in Turkey. During my term there, we updated the websites of our projects and competition for a better user experience. Moreover, as pandemic began, we shifted  100% online for the rest of the process. Accordingly, we designed a website for the finals of the competition in 2020. </p> 
							<li>Westpac Group, Customer Experience Lab Project Consultant</li>

							<p>When pursuing my CEMS Master's in International Management degree, I had the chance to work in a project of one of the biggest banks in Australia. As team of five student consultants, we worked with the Strategy and Customer Experience team for six months. The project we worked on was in wealth management sector. We conducted global and local competition and market analyses, researched customer needs and trends on wealth management services, and finally presented a solution to the Westpac Group Executive Board. </p>
